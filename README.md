## my nix-darwin config

This repository contains my personal `nix-darwin` setup for managing macOS system settings, packages, and applications declaratively using Nix. Inspired by [ryan4yin/nix-darwin-kickstarter](https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-darwin-kickstarter), it features declarative system configuration, home configuration including Git, shell, and core settings, GUI apps installed via Homebrew (`modules/apps.nix`), and custom scripts to streamline package installation.
